You should change <location>file:///D:/Library/Downloads/test.mkv</location> to <location>file:///./test.mkv</location>. 
Just change it for all files using text editor. It works for me (version 3.0.6 and next versions). 
So it will work if you change the name of directory or change the disk. 
But your playlist file shoud be with songs it used. 
I think it's a reason why vlc will use only absolute path in future. 
It's more comfortable if you are not going to move your songs
