First go to this website: https://nssm.cc/ and download NSSM.

Copy nssm.exe to same directory that rclone is in. I launched NSSM, by opening an elevated command line. 
Type cmd in the search bar and right click and choose “run as administrator.”

    1. cd c:\rclone (or wherever you have rclone located)
    2. nssm install “Rclone Mount” <- the name inside the quotes can be changed to whatever you like 
    3. Fill in the info below, press install.
	
	Application tab:
	Path: C:\rclone\rclone.exe
	Startup Directory: C:\rclone
	Arguments: mount gdrive-crypt: s: --config "C:\rclone\rclone.conf" <- change this directory to match your own CONF file.
	Service name: Rclone Mount <- again, this can be changed

	Details tab:
	Display name: Rclone Mount <- change this if needed
	Description: Automatically mounts the encrypted <your drive here> using rclone.

	Exit actions tab:
	Delay restart by: 10000 ms (10 seconds)

    4. Still in the command prompt, type "services.msc". Scroll down and choose your service and right click and start it.
    5. If it fails to start, stop the service.
    6. Go back to command prompt and run the following line sc.exe delete “Rclone Mount”
    7. Repeat steps 2 to 5 to troubleshoot any errors.

Going to post the various parts of NSSM that I’ve filled in. Originally it was failing because when I did the copy paste, 
for some reason it was doing one dash and one hyphen. I could paste it to command line and it would work. 
But to NSSM it would change it to hyphen. So I ended up just typing it out, instead of copy paste.

If I didn’t reference it above, I didn’t change it away from defaults.
